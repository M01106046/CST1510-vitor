# ==================================================================== INPUT
# 1. Ask for your three values.
#
#    - the first is TEXT      (a name, a hostname, an IP)  -> no conversion needed
#    - the second is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())
#    - the third  is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())


over_count = 0
while True:
    label = input("Type the label: ")      # : replace with an input() call
    if label == "quit":
            break
    
    first = float(input("Type the used number: "))     # : replace with an input() call, converted
    second = float(input("Type the total number: "))    # : replace with an input() call, converted


# ================================================================== PROCESS
# 2. Work out the difference and the percentage.       [Typical and above]

    difference = second - first
    percent = (first / second) * 100 if second != 0 else 0

# 3. Decide a status and store it in a variable called status.
#
#    Threshold : if / else        -> "OVER LIMIT" or "OK"
#    Typical   : if / elif / else -> "OVER LIMIT" (100% or more),
#                                     "WARNING" (90% or more), otherwise "OK"

    status = "OVER LIMIT" if percent >= 100 else "WARNING" if percent >= 90 else "OK"
    if status == "OVER LIMIT":
        over_count += 1

# =================================================================== OUTPUT
# 4. Print the report.
#
#    Threshold : the three values you were given, plus status, inside a border
#    Typical   : add difference and percent, 2 decimal places, right-aligned
#    Excellent : wrap sections 1-4 in a loop so you can check as many records
#                as you like in one run - type "quit" as the label to stop.
#                Keep count of how many came back OVER LIMIT and print that
#                once, after the loop ends.


    print()
    print("=" * 34)
    print(f"  RECORD CHECK  -  {label}")
    print("=" * 34)

    print(f"  Used        : {first:10.2f}")
    print(f"  Total       : {second:>10.2f}")
    print(f"  Free        : {difference:>10.2f}")
    print(f"  Percent used: {percent:>10.2f} %")
    print(f"  Status      : {status:>10}")
    print("=" * 34)

print(f"\nRecords OVER LIMIT: {over_count}")

# ==========================================================================
# 5. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it three times with different numbers
#    [ ] Run it with a total of 0 and note the error (do not fix it yet)
#    [ ] Check every variable name says what it holds
