# =================================================================== FUNCTIONS
# 1. Write parse_line(raw_line) that cleans and parses one raw, messy line
#    into a dict. Handle inconsistent spacing and case - that is the whole
#    point of this week.
#
#    Typical and above: also write status_of(...), shaped for your lane
#    (e.g. OVER LIMIT / WARNING / OK, or FLAGGED / OK). Give both a
#    one-line docstring.

# your function(s) go here
def parse_line(raw_line):
    """Cleans and parses a raw survey record into a dictionary."""
    parts = raw_line.strip().lower().split(",")

    data = {
        "survey": parts[0].strip(),
        "rating": int(parts[1].split("=")[1].strip()),
        "age": int(parts[2].split("=")[1].strip())
    }

    return data
# ====================================================================== INPUT
# 2. Your raw, messy records - at least 5, deliberately varied in spacing
#    and case. Match the shape to your lane:
#
#    AI / Data Science : "  Survey_2026 , rating=4 , age=23  "
#    Cyber Security     : "SRC=10.0.0.5,ATTEMPTS=12,RESULT=FAILED"
#    IT                  : "  Srv-01 , used=87 , total=100  "
#
#    Excellent: save these lines to a file and load them with open() /
#    a for loop over the file, instead of writing them directly here.

raw_records = [
    "  Survey_2026 , rating=4 , age=23  ",
]


# =============================================================== PROCESS + OUTPUT
# 3. Parse and report on every record.
#
#    Threshold : parse each record, print the cleaned dict.
#    Typical   : also call status_of(...) for each, print it alongside.
#    Excellent : print a one-line summary at the end - how many records,
#                how many flagged.

for raw_record in raw_records:
    data = parse_line(raw_record)
    print(data)


# ==========================================================================
# 4. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it against at least 5 genuinely messy raw records
#    [ ] Run it with a value that will not convert to a number - write the
#        error down
#    [ ] Check every function does one job, with a docstring
